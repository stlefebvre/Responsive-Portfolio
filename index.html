        <p>My name is Shelby Lefebvre (pronounced "Le-FAVE"). I live in Newmarket, NH. I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2014 with a B.A. in Journalism with a concentration in Economics. I currently work in Exeter, NH. I have a well-rounded, homegrown sense of sarcastic New England humor, but I mean well!</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I'm an avid reader, food eater, amateur singer/rapper, and bar trivia answer-er (the jury's still out as to whether I'm right or not). I dabble in photography with my Nikon from time to time, and am fully committed to being a strong role model for my roommate's cat.</p>

        <p>My ultimate goal is to establish a career in web development to hone skills I've invested my time in, and to be competetive in the ever-changing technology industry. I am ready and excited to challenge myself!</p>
